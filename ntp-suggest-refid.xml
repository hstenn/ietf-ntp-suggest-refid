	NTP's Reference ID, or REFID, identifies the source of time in
	a timestamp or time packet.  In network NTP packets, the REFID
	is used to identify the "system peer", and in the long-term
	general case its fundamental purpose is to prevent a
	one-degree timing loop.  Each instance of NTP decides for
	itself what REFID it will put in its outgoing packets, and
	there is currently no way for an external time source to tell
	or recommend this value in the case where that external time
	source is selected as the "system peer."
      </t>

      <t>
	The SUGGESTED-REFID NTP Extension Field proposal is a
	backward-compatible way for a time source to tell its peers or
	clients "If you use me as your system peer, use this nonce as
	your REFID."
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the
	latest being <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>.  A core
	component of the protocol and the algorithms is the Reference
	ID, or REFID, which is used to identify the time source.
	Traditionally, when the source of time was another system the
	REFID was the IPv4 address of that other system.  If the
	remote system was using IPv6 for its connection, a 4 octet
	digest value of the IPv6 address was used. The general case
	core purpose of the REFID is to prevent a one-degree timing
	loop (where if A has several timing sources that include B, if
	B decides to get its time from A we don't want A then deciding
	to get its time from B). The REFID is considered to be "public
	data" and is a vital core-component of the base NTP packet.
	In an increasingly hostile Internet, knowledge of a system's
	time source is abusable information.  If a system's REFID is
	the IPv4 address of its system peer, an attacker can try to
	use that information to send spoofed time packets to either or
	both the target or the target's server, attempting to cause a
	disruption in time service.  There is also a clear use-case
	for having a special REFID for use if systems are exchanging
	leap-smeared time.  This proposal is a backward-compatible way
	for a time source to tell its peers or clients "If you use me
	as your system peer, use this nonce as your REFID."  This
	nonce, a Suggested REFID, SHOULD be untraceable to the sending
	system.  When used to hide the identity of a server, if the
	receiving system uses this Suggested REFID nonce instead of
	the IPv4 address as its REFID, this type of attack and
	information disclosure is prevented.  When used to indicate
	that a system is either offering leap-smeared time or is
	synchronized to a leap-smeared time source, this information
	can be used to prevent unwanted synchronization to a source
	that is not offering the "flavor" of time we want, and, in the
	case where a leap smear correction continues into the next
	day, the second half of a leap smear correction can be applied
	in the expected manner.
      </t>

      <t>
	This SUGGESTED-REFID NTP Extension Field proposal is a simple,
	clean, backward-compatible way for an external time soure to
	request that the receiving system use the provided nonce in
	the case where the receiving system uses the sending system as
	its system peer.
      </t>

        "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

        in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="The REFID">
      <t>
	The core reason for the REFID in the NTP Protocol is to
	prevent a timing loop of degree 1.  Put another way, if
	servers A and B are exchanging time with each other and server
	B decides to follow A as its system peer, the REFID that B
	will use must be able to identify server A.  The
	interpretation of a REFID is based on the stratum, as
	documented in <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>, section
	7.3, "Packet Header Variables".  At Stratum 2+, which will be
	the case if servers A and B are exchanging packets over IPv4,
	if server B follows A, then B will have A's IPv4 address as
	its REFID.  When A asks B for its time, A will see that B is
	synchronized to A because B will tell A that its REFID is A's
	IPv4 address, so when A sees its IP address as B's REFID, A
	knows that if it were to follow B for its time then there
	would be a timing loop.  In this case, A will not select B as
	a potential source of time.
      </t>

      <t>
	Another related use case for the REFID centers around the
	increasing use of leap-smearing time servers when the
	insertion (or any eventual deleiton) of a leap second occurs.
	It is critical that operators and client systems be able to
	identify when a server is offering leap-smeared time.
	Futhermore, with the current practice of smearing the
	insertion of a leap second starting at noon UTC on the day of
	the leap event and completing the smear at noon UTC on the day
	after the leap event, a server that is operating during a leap
	smear event must be able to immediately identify if it should
	respond with either correct or leap-smeared time.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Suggested REFID Extension Field">
      <t>
	Since there is no way in the base NTP packet for "this"
	instance of an NTP server to tell the "other" instance what
	REFID it should use if the "other" instance decides to use
	"this" instance as its system peer, the best available way to
	convey this information is via an extension field.

      <t>Examples: When decoded as an IPv4 address, a random nonce
      suggested REFID would decode as 253.0.0.0 thru
      253.255.255.255.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Generating and Sending a Nonce as the Suggested REFID Extension Field">
      <t>
	A system that decides to send a nonce as a Suggested REFID
	extension field SHOULD generate a new Suggested REFID nonce
	for each new association.  It MAY generate a new Suggested
	REFID nonce for any association in any response.  In addition
	to remembering the IP-based REFID, the sender MUST also
	remember its most-recent Suggested REFID nonce.
      </t>

      <t>
	Since the core NTPv4 and earlier protocols do not contain any
	way to tell the recipient what to use as a REFID and <xref
	target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref> uses the IPv4 address of the
	sender as the REFID if the association is effected over an
	IPv4 connection, this means that an attacker can simply send
	an NTP client request to a server knowing that server's system
	peer will be returned as the REFID in the response packet.  At
	this point, an attacker can, if that REFID is an IPv4 address,
	begin to launch attacks at the target forging the putative
	<!-- HMS: Not the best word --> IP of the target's time
	source, or the attacker can start forging packets to the
	putative time server claiming to be from the target, in an
	attempt to cause the time server to limit or deny time service
	to the target.
      </t>

      <t>
	Using a nonce for the REFID that is only recognized by the
	sending machine effectively prevents this type of attack.
      </t>

      <t>
	If servers S1, S2, and S3 are all exchanging time with each
	other and are all using the Suggested REFID mechanism, there
	is a 3 in 16,777,216 (2^24) chance that two different servers
	in the same group will happen to choose the same nonce, and
	that would produce a false-positive timing loop detection.  If
	a nonce Suggested REFID is never changed, this false-positive
	condition will occur for potentially a long time.  This small
	risk can be reduced by periodically generating a new Suggested
	REFID.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Remembering a Nonce Suggested REFID Extension Field">
      <t>
	An NTP server keeps track of the IP address it uses to talk to
	its peers.  If an NTP server chooses to send a Suggested REFID
	to an associated peer, the server MUST remember this value.
	When checking for a timing loop, the Suggested REFID must also
	be included in the list of tested REFID values.
      </t>

      <t>
	A set of NTP servers that are acting as a group of time
	servers SHOULD be using peer associations (NTP mode 1 and 2
	packets), and SHOULD NOT be using client/server (NTP mode 3
	and 4) exchanges.  Nevertheless, implementors should be aware
	that the recommendation against using client/server
	associations for time groups may be ignored, and should be
	conscious of the choices they make and the configuration
	options they offer in order to accomodate (or at least
	document) this situation.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Suggested REFID Extension Field and Leap Smear REFIDs">
      <t>
	The Suggested REFID can play an important part when a server
	has a client population that receives leap-smeared time.
      </t>

      <t>
	The current preferred behavior for servers that offer
	leap-smeared time is to offer leap-smeared time in response to
	appropriate client (mode 3) requests.  There are several
	forces at play during this time:
	<t><list>
	  <t>Clients that want correct time should get correct
	  time.</t>
	  <t>Clients that want leap-smeared time should get
	  leap-smeared time.<\t>
	</list></t>
	An additional complication is that a leap-second insertion
	event begins at noon UTC, when the
	Leap Indicator is 1, but the smear is only halfway applied at
	midnight UTC, when the Leap Indicator changes back to 0.
	There is no simple way for the client to let its server(s)
	know that it is using leap-smeared time.
      </t>

      <t>
	One simple way for the client to let its server(s) know that
	it is using and wants leap-smeared time is for the client to use a Leap
	Smear REFID in its client (mode 3) requests during the entire
	leap smear period.
