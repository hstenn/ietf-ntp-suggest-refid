      <t>NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the latest
	being <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>.  A core component of
	the protocol and the algorithms is the Reference ID, or REFID, which
	is used to identify the source of time used for synchronization.
	Traditionally, when the source of time was another system the REFID
	was the IPv4 address of that other system.  The purpose of the REFID
	is to prevent a one-degree timing loop, where if A has several
	timing sources that include B, if B decides to get its time from A
	we don't want A then deciding to get its time from B.  The REFID is
	considered to be "public data" and is a vital core-component of the
	base NTP packet.  If a system's REFID is the IPv4 address of its
	system peer, an attacker can try to use that information to send
	spoofed time packets to either or both the target or the target's
	server, attempting to cause a disruption in time service.  This
	proposal is a backward-compatible way for a time source to tell its
	peers or clients "If you use me as your system peer, use this nonce
	as your REFID."  This nonce SHOULD be untraceable to the original
	system, and if it is used as the REFID this type of attack is
	prevented.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>NTP has been widely used through several revisions, with the latest
	being <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>.  A core component of
	the protocol and the algorithms is the Reference ID, or REFID, which
	is used to identify the source of time used for synchronization.
	Traditionally, when the source of time was another system, the REFID
	was the IPv4 address of that other system.  If the remote system was
	using IPv6 for its connection, a 4 octet digest value of the IPv6
	address was used. The purpose of the REFID is to prevent a
	one-degree timing loop, where if A has several timing sources that
	include B, if B decides to get its time from A we don't want A then
	deciding to get its time from B. The REFID is considered to be
	"public data" and is a vital core-component of the base NTP packet.
	If a system's REFID is the IPv4 address of its system peer, an
	attacker can try to use that information to send spoofed time
	packets to either or both the target or the target's server,
	attempting to cause a disruption in time service.  This proposal is
	a backward-compatible way for a time source to tell its peers or
	clients "If you use me as your system peer, use this nonce as your
	REFID."  This nonce, a Suggested REFID, SHOULD be untraceable to the
	sending system.  If the receiving system uses this Suggested REFID
	nonce instead of the IPv4 address as its REFID, this type of attack
	and information disclosure is prevented.</t>

      <t>The NTP protocol was designed with a mechanism that allowed for a
	depth-1 loop detection to avoid a simple "time loop".  Recently,
	this mechanism was discovered to be a potential vulnerability
	exploit.  The best way to mitigate this vulnerability is to decouple
	the IPv4 address of the server from its REFID.  But there is no
	current way for a potential time source to tell the other party any
	other alternative to use as the REFID.  This proposal creates an
	extension field to accomplish this.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
          NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
          in this document are to be interpreted as described
          in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="The REFID">
      <t>The core reason for the REFID in the NTP Protocol is to prevent a
	timing loop of degree 1.  Put another way, if servers A and B are
	exchanging time with each other and server B decides to follow A as
	its system peer, the REFID that B will use must be able to identify
	server A.  The interpretation of a REFID is based on the stratum, as
	documented in <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref>, section 7.3,
	"Packet Header Variables".  At Stratum 2+, which will be the case if
	servers A and B are exchanging packets over IPv4, if server B
	follows A, then B will have A's IPv4 address as its REFID.  When A
	asks B for its time, A will see that B is synchronized to A because
	B will tell A that its REFID is A's IPv4 address, so when A sees its
	IP address as B's REFID, A knows that if it were to follow B for its
	time then there would be a timing loop.  In this case, A will not
	select B as a potential source of time.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Suggested REFID Extension Field">
      <t>Since there is no way in the base NTP packet for "this" instance of
	an NTP server to tell the "other" instance what REFID it should use
	if the "other" instance decides to use "this" instance as its system
	peer, the best available way to convey this information is via an
	extension field.</t>

      MAC required), 0x2006 (Suggested REFID, MAC OPTIONAL))</t>
      <t>Field Length: 0x0008</t>
      <t>Suggested REFID: The 4 octets of the suggested REFID.
	This value SHOULD be 0xFDxxxxxx, where the bottom 3 octets SHOULD be
	random values.</t>
      <t>Examples: When decoded as an IPv4 address, suggested REFIDs would
	decode as 253.0.0.0 thru 253.255.255.255.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Generating and Sending the Suggested REFID Extension Field">
      <t>A system that decides to send a Suggested REFID extension field
	SHOULD generate a new Suggested REFID for each new association.  It
	MAY generate a new Suggested REFID for any association in any
	response.  In addition to remembering the IP-based REFID, the sender
	MUST also remember its most-recent Suggested REFID.</t>

      <t>Since the core NTPv4 and earlier protocols do not contain any way
	to tell the recipient what to use as a REFID
	and <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref> uses the IPv4 address of
	the sender as the REFID if the association is effected over an IPv4
	connection, this means that an attacker can simply send an NTP
	client request to a server knowing that server's system peer will be
	returned as the REFID in the response packet.  At this point, an
	attacker can, if that REFID is an IPv4 address, begin to launch
	attacks at the target forging the putative <!-- HMS: Not the best
	word --> IP of the target's time source, or the attacker can start
	forging packets to the putative time server claiming to be from the
	target, in an attempt to cause the time server to limit or deny time
	service to the target.</t>

      <t>Using a nonce for the REFID that is only recognized by the sending
	machine effectively prevents this type of attack.</t>

      <t>If servers S1, S2, and S3 are all exchanging time with each other
	and are all using the Suggested REFID mechanism, there is a 3 in
	16,777,216 (2^24) chance that two different servers in the same
	group will happen to choose the same nonce, and that would produce a
	false-positive timing loop detection.  If the Suggested REFID is
	never changed, this false-positive condition will occur for
	potentially a long time.  This small risk can be reduced by
	periodically generating a new Suggested REFID.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Receiving a Suggested REFID Extension Field">
      <t>An NTP server keeps track of the IP address it uses to talk to a
	client.  If an NTP server chooses to send a Suggested REFID to an
	association, it MUST remember this value.  When checking for a
	timing loop, the Suggested REFID must also be included in the list
	of tested values.</t>
